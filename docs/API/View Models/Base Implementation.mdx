# `ViewModelBase` class  

This is base implementation of the [`ViewModel` interface](/api/view-models/interface)  


## Methods and properties  
Here is documentation about base implementation methods and properties. If you want to read about `ViewModel` methods and properties [go to here](/api/view-models/interface)  

### `unmountSignal`   
This is `AbortSignal` which signaled when your [`ViewModel`](/api/view-models/interface) is unmounted. It happens in [`didUnmount()`](/api/view-models/interface#didunmount) method   


### `vmConfig`  
This is view models configuration, you can read here about it    

## Details

### [`mount()`](/api/view-models/interface#mount)  

#### `isMounted`  
This method sets [`isMounted`](/api/view-models/interface#ismounted) to `true`.   
If you are overriding this method be sure that you called the [`super.mount()`](/api/view-models/interface#mount), 
otherwise your view component connected to this ViewModel never been rendered
because inside [`withViewModel`](/react/api/with-view-model) HOC libary comparing the [`isMounted`](/api/view-models/interface#ismounted) flag with `true` before render the view component  


#### `async mount()`  
This method can be async. This feature is helpful if you want to load some data or do something before view component will been rendered  

```ts
import { ViewModelBase } from 'mobx-view-model';
class YourVM extends ViewModelBase {
  async mount() {
    await when(() => this.fruits.isLoaded);

    if (this.fruits.data) {
      super.mount();
    } else {
      this.rootStore.router.navigate('/no-fruits');
    }
  }
}
```

### [setPayload()]  
Base implementation of this method `strict` comparing current payload and new payload before sets the new  
This can be overriden using [view models configuration](/api/view-models/view-models-config) or overriding the protected `isPayloadEqual` method
