# ViewModel  

It is a part of [`MVVM`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)
 architectural pattern. 

The `ViewModel` is responsible for providing data from the model to the view (the user interface). 
This is a brain for Views in your web application.
It represents ability to separate business logic from view layer and isolate it inside `ViewModel`
