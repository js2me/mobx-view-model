# `ViewModel<Payload, ParentViewModel>` interface  

Interface that helps to integrate part of MVVM pattern into your application.  
All code examples will be includes the [base implementation](/api/view-models/base-implementation) of this interface  


## Generics  

### 1. `Payload`  
Declares the payload data for your `ViewModel`.
Can be helpful if you need to transfer some data between view models or views   

### 2. `ParentViewModel`   
Declares the parent `ViewModel` where current `ViewModel` is rendered in hierarchy.  
Can be helpful if you need to access to parent view model using `parentViewModel`  

## Methods and properties  

### `id`  
Unique identifier for the view model  

### `payload`  
Object that contains the data that is passed from the parent component.  

### `isMounted`  
State that determines if `ViewModel` is mounted together with a component.  
This state is needed to control rendering the view component connected to your `ViewModel`  
If this state always be `false` then your view component never been rendered.  

### `isUnmounting`  
State that determines if `ViewModel` is unmounting together with a view component.  

### `parentViewModel`   
Parent `ViewModel` of the current `ViewModel`  

:::warning   
This property works only if you are using [`ViewModelStore`](/api/view-model-store/interface) (integrated in React with using [ViewModelsProvider](/react/api/view-models-provider)) or [`withViewModel` HOC](/react/api/with-view-model)  
:::

Example:   
```ts
import { ViewModelBase } from "mobx-view-model";

class ParentVM extends ViewModelBase {
  foo = 'bar'
}

class MyVM extends ViewModelBase<{}, ParentVM> { // second generic as type for parent view model
  get baz() {
    return this.parentViewModel.foo; // 'bar'
  }
}
```

### `willUnmount()`  
This method is called when the component is starts unmounting from the [React](https://react.dev) tree.  
Before [`unmount()`](#unmount) method  

### `unmount()`  
This method is called when the component is unmounted from the [React](https://react.dev) tree.  

:::note The behavior of the `unmount()` method may depend on the implementation of your [ViewModelStore](/api/view-model-store/interface).  
The base implementation assumes that after calling this method, the [`isMounted`](#ismounted) state will be `false`.  
:::

:::tip
this method can return a Promise for lazy unmounting of the view model.
:::

### `willMount()`  
this method is called when the component is starts mounting in the [React](https://react.dev) tree.  

### `mount()`  
This method is called when the component is mounted in the [React](https://react.dev) tree.  

:::note The behavior of the `mount()` method may depend on the implementation of your ViewModelStore.  
The base implementation assumes that after calling this method, the [`isMounted`](#ismounted) state will be `true`.  
:::

:::tip
this method can return a Promise for lazy mounting of the view model.
:::


:::note
For your own implementation of this interface recommends set `true` to [`isMounted`](#ismounted) in this method.
:::

### `didMount()`  
This method that is called after the view model is fully mounted.  

### `didUnmount()`  
this method that is called after the view model is fully unmounted.  

### `setPayload(payload: Payload)`  
This method that sets the payload of the view model.  

### `payloadChanged()`  
This method that is called when the payload is changed.
