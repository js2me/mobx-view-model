# `ViewModel<Payload, ParentViewModel>` interface  

Interface that helps to integrate part of MVVM pattern into your application.  

## Generics  

### 1. `Payload`  
Declares the payload data for your `ViewModel`.
Can be helpful if you need to transfer some data between view models or views   

### 2. `ParentViewModel`   
Declares the parent `ViewModel` where current `ViewModel` is rendered in hierarchy.  
Can be helpful if you need to access to parent view model using `parentViewModel`  

## Methods and properties  

### `id`  
Unique identifier for the view model  

### `payload`  
Object that contains the data that is passed from the parent component.  

### `isMounted`  
State that determines if `ViewModel` is mounted together with a component.  
This state is needed to control rendering the view component connected to your `ViewModel`  
If this state always be `false` then your view component never been rendered.  

### `isUnmounting`  
State that determines if `ViewModel` is unmounting together with a view component.  

### `parentViewModel`   
Parent `ViewModel` of the current `ViewModel`  

:::warning   
This property works only if you are using [`ViewModelStore`](/api/view-model-store/interface) (integrated in React with using [ViewModelsProvider](/react/api/view-models-provider)) or [`withViewModel` HOC](/react/api/with-view-model)
