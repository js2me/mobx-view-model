# Minified error `#1`: Active `ViewModel` not found   

This happened because [`vmLookup`](/api/other/view-model-lookup) for hook [`useViewModel`](/react/api/use-view-model) is not provided and hook trying to lookup active view model using `ActiveViewModelContext` which works only with using [`withViewModel`](/react/api/with-view-model) HOC.   


## Explanation:  

This usage of hook [`useViewModel`](/react/api/use-view-model)   

```tsx
const model = useViewModel<YourVM>();
```

Will use `ActiveViewModelContext` which exist only with usage [`withViewModel`](/react/api/with-view-model) HOC.   

Also this can be happened if you are trying to get access to active `ViewModel` which is not exist in current React render tree:   

```tsx
<Component1>
  <ComponentAChild1>
    <Component>
      useViewModel<YourVM>()
    </Component>
  </ComponentAChild1>
  <YourVMComponent /> - this provide active `ViewModel` (withViewModel)
</Component1>
```

## Potential solution

The potential solution to this problem is to pass the [`vmLookup`](/api/other/view-model-lookup) to the hook [`withViewModel`](/react/api/with-view-model)   

```tsx
const model = useViewModel(YourVM);
const model = useViewModel('idofyourvm');
```

Or use `useViewModel<YourVM>()` with correct provided active `ViewModel` React render tree:   

```tsx
<YourVMComponent> - this provide active `ViewModel` (withViewModel)
  <Component1>
    <ComponentAChild1>
      <Component>
        useViewModel<YourVM>()
      </Component>
    </ComponentAChild1>
  </Component1>
</YourVMComponent>
```
