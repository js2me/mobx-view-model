**mobx-view-model** is a library for integration MVVM pattern with MobX and React.  

## Motivation  

The main goal of this library is to make it easier to use the MVVM pattern.  

## Pros and cons  

Pros:  
 - easier separation of business logic from the presentation layer ([React](https://react.dev/)/etc).  
 - more flexibility and easier integration of `React` ecosystem (and possibly not only `React`) with `MobX`  

Cons:  
 - additional `HOC` `withViewModel()` wrapping the component in an additional component, which in turn wraps the outer component in `observer()`  
 - additional kilobytes in your bundle  

## About MVVM  

[MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) is an architectural pattern in computer software that facilitates the separation of the development of a graphical user interface (GUI; the view)—be it via a markup language or GUI code—from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) such thatd
the view is not dependent upon any specific model platform.
